`0x07-networking_basics`

Networking is the practice of connecting and communicating between devices, systems, or computers to share resources,
information, and services. It forms the foundation of the internet and enables devices to communicate and exchange
data with each other. Let's cover some key networking basics:

1. `Network Components:`

	`Devices`: These are the physical devices that make up a network, such as computers, routers, switches,
	printers, and smartphones.

	`Cables/Wireless`: Networks can be wired, using Ethernet cables, or wireless, using Wi-Fi or other wireless
	technologies.

	`Network Interface Cards (NIC)`: They are hardware components that enable devices to connect to a network.
	NICs provide a unique identifier called MAC (Media Access Control) address.

	`Router:`: A router connects different networks together and directs data packets between them. It determines
	the best path for data to reach its destination.

	`Switch:`: A switch connects devices within a local network and forwards data packets to their intended
	destination based on their MAC addresses.

2. `Network Protocols:`

	`TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)`: The fundamental protocol suite used on the internet
	and most networks today. It enables reliable data transmission across interconnected networks.

	`HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)`: Used for web communication, delivering web pages, and resources over the
	internet.

	`FTP (File Transfer Protocol)`: Used for transferring files between computers on a network.

	`SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)`: Used for sending and receiving emails.

	`DNS (Domain Name System)`: Translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses.

	`DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)`: Assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices on the network.

3. `IP Addresses:`

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network. It serves as a unique
identifier that enables devices to locate and communicate with each other. There are two versions of
IP addresses: IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

4. `Network Topologies:`

	`Star Topology`: Devices connect to a central hub or switch.

	`Bus Topology`: Devices are connected to a central cable.

	`Ring Topology`: Devices form a closed loop, and each device connects to two others.

5. `Network Security:`

	`Firewall`: A security barrier between internal and external networks, controlling traffic based on predefined
	rules.

	`Encryption`: Securing data by converting it into a code to prevent unauthorized access.

	`VPN (Virtual Private Network)`: A secure tunnel that allows remote users to access a private network over the
	internet.

6. `Network Address Translation (NAT):`

NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. It helps in conserving IP
addresses and providing an additional layer of security.

Networking is a vast and ever-evolving field with many more advanced concepts, but these basics should give you a good
starting point to understand how devices communicate and interact on networks.
