`Processes:`

Imagine your computer is like a busy kitchen. In this kitchen, different tasks are happening simultaneously, like
cooking, cleaning, and chopping vegetables. Each of these tasks is like a process on your computer. A process is just
a program (like a game or a web browser) that is running and doing something at a specific moment.

`Signals:`

Now, let's say you're working in the kitchen and you need to ask your friend for help. Instead of shouting loudly,
you can use hand signals to communicate with your friend. In the same way, signals in a computer are like small
messages sent to processes to tell them to do something specific.

For example, you can send a signal to a process to ask it to pause, stop, or do something else. It's like sending
a note to a process to tell it what to do next.

`Putting it together:`

In a computer, many programs (processes) are running at the same time. Sometimes, one process might get stuck or
misbehave. Just like in the kitchen, you may need to send a signal to that process to ask it to stop or do something
else.

In Bash (a type of command-line interface on your computer), you can use special commands to send signals to processes.
For example, if you want a process to stop, you can use the "Ctrl + C" signal. It's like telling the process to finish
what it's doing and stop.

So, processes are like different tasks running on your computer, and signals are like messages you can send to those
tasks to ask them to do something specific.

Keep in mind that understanding processes and signals at a deeper technical level can get more complex, but this basic
explanation should give you a good idea of what they are and how they work!
